#Amazon Vine - Review Bias Analysis

Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to identify if there was review bias for items sold by manufacturers that are part of the amazon vine program.  To analyze this, the review data from one product categories (musical instruments) was sub-sampled and the data was filtered to determine how many products with 5 star reviews and more than 20 reviews with at least 50% being voted helpful and their relative percentages from manufacturers that were part of the vine program and not part of the vine program.

Results: 

- There were 60 Vine reviews, and 14477 non-vine reviews for musical instruments
- There were 34 5-star vine reviews, and 8212 non-vine 5-star reviews for musical instruments
- The percentage of vine reviews with 5 stars was 56.67%, the percentage of non-vine reviews with 5 stars was 56.72%

Summary:
Based on the product category of musical instruments alone, the percentage of 5 star reviewed musical instruments with more than 20 helpful reviews and was roughly equal in both vine and non-vine sellers, thus there should be no review bias. However, there were far more musical instruments reviews in the non-vine product category, suggesting that a large majority of sellers chose not to be part of the vine program and recieve the same reviews. This would indicate that the vine program does not provide additional exposure or sales benefits for sellers as opposed to sellers that chose to opt into the vine program. Since the vast majority of musical insturments category is non-vine, there is a question of whether the vine sample size is appropriate for this statistical comparison. Typically musicians particular with the exact make and model of their instruments. Another analysis that could be conducted is to measure the number of 5 star reviews against the total number of listings, then filter for the number of products with more than 20 reviews from verified purchases and weigh the percentages based on that number as a coefficient.
